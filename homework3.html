  <h1>Homework 3</h1>
  <h2>Three Rooms</h2>
  <br>
  <p>I ran out of time in the media lab and just started snapping as many pictures as I could before they made me leave. There's some ambitions here I didn't quite get to fulfill. I started by making the ghosts first, then got the idea to make the graveyard in the basement. The graves took more time than I anticipated, which is how I ran out of time. I like the verticality of the gallery room even if I didn't get to finish the chandelier or paintings. I picture a younger, first homeowner version of the Crypt Keeper living here, if anyone remembers Tales from the Crypt.</p>
