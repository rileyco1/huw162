  <h1>Final</h1>
  <br>
  <p>This little guy is pretty much all that survived, thankfully preserved by the Mixamo website as my last upload.
I had time between finals today to use the media lab and add the colors back in along with the music. I found that adding
materials after the Mixamo animations avoided that weird gloss effect that sometimes happens. The song is
"Kiss Me Again (Original Edit)" by Dinosaur, taken from the 'Disco Not Disco' compilation. The whole theme of the labyrinth was
going to be some of the weirder stuff in my vinyl collection, with these 10-second snippets jumping from genre to genre.
The reason this alien dude is sporting a mohawk is because this song was going to transition into some punk, specifically
"Human Being" from the New York Dolls album, 'Too Much Too Soon.' He's green and purple because of that Martian bird thing from
Looney Tunes. I originally made him a mouth but I liked him better with just eyes; he speaks only with his sweet, sweet
dance moves.</p>
